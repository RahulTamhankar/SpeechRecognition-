What is speech recognition?
The ability of a machine or programme to recognise words spoken aloud and translate them into legible text is known as voice recognition, often known as speech-to-text. Basic voice recognition software can only pick out words and phrases that are uttered clearly and has a small repertoire. More advanced software can handle diverse languages, accents, and natural speech.
